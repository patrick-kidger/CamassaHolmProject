To-get-things-working ideas:
Do more with auxiliary functions? See how third_reg goes with log either end.
** add l1/l2 regularisation?
coarser grids?
tighter to zero initialisation
** try 1000x10 networks again?  - on more VMs?
** try old training method
** Switch to ELUs
ask to predict difference from some kind of interpolation
Mix of optimisation algorithms

TODO:
Algebra for multipeakons
Numerical analysis for nonzero k
Test machine with multipeakons + nonzero k
Write up!
