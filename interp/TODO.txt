To-get-things-working ideas:
Do more with auxiliary functions? See how third_reg goes with log either end.
add l1/l2 regularisation?
tighter to zero initialisation
ask to predict difference from some kind of interpolation
Don't ask for predictions around the peak
Mix of optimisation algorithms

TODO:
coarser grids?
Algebra for multipeakons
Numerical analysis for nonzero k
Test machine with multipeakons + nonzero k
Write up!
